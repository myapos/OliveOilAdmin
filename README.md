The system detects the display means (mobile, tablet, pc layout) and adjusts the display of appropriately. The system administrator can modify database tables properly and has great potential. On the other hand the user mill is informed of the total matching results of all mills uses appropriate filters (eg only promotes its own results or display the relation of production - demand by region). The demand is stored in the system as a table in the DB and can be updated or manually by the administrator.
